### Hosted Project Link
[404-tawny-delta.vercel.app]

### Project Description
[ RAWAAZ is an intelligent web and mobile-based website designed to provide personalized fashion recommendations based on user preferences, body type, skin tone, lifestyle, and occasion.]

### The Problem statement
[Many people find it difficult to choose suitable outfits that match their body type, skin tone, personal style, and occasion. Existing fashion platforms provide generic suggestions and lack personalization, inclusivity, and sustainability. Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent AI-based system that offers customized, secure, and user-friendly fashion recommendations to enhance confidence and simplify styling decisions.
]

### The Solution
[The AI Fashion Stylist helps Indian women choose suitable outfits by analyzing their body type, skin tone, lifestyle, cultural preferences, and occasions. It provides personalized outfit and accessory recommendations instead of generic suggestions.
The system also helps users manage their wardrobe, reduce unnecessary shopping, and promotes sustainable fashion choices. By offering secure, inclusive, and culturally relevant styling guidance, it makes fashion decisions easier, affordable, and confidence-boosting for Indian women.]
